        float data type is used when dealing with figures that bear decimal points e.g ksh30.60
        float amount = 78.9;
        boolean datatype takes the two conditions true or false
        char-this is single character datatype
        double-THis like float datatype reprent numbers with decimal precision
        int-This is used to rep whole numbers
